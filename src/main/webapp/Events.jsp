We have worked with the Project Management Institute Northern Alberta Chapter for over<br> a decade and itâ€™s safe to say we feel like a part of the family. From the familiar faces in the<br> crowd of attendees, to the trust built with sponsors and speakers, the committee and <br>board can count on us to represent their Chapter and execute a seamless conference!</p>
